---Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Program---

In this code I use object oriented program to create an interactive RPSLS game

I have 5 game objects as well as 5 bots that play the game in specific ways

The goal of this lab is to very heavily use the concepts of Object Oriented Design therefor we have multiple classes
